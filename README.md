A robotic hand that is controlled only through camera.
Using the video feed and CNN the key points of the body are extracted and then angles to control the hand are calculated and sent over bluetooth to robotic hand.
You can see the contol person on the screen of the laptop, angles are scaled 2x to provide the full range of motion.

## to run 
run mpii_demo.py (in Fast_H...) and control.ipynb at the same time.
